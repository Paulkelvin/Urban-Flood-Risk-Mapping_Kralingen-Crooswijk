## Project Overview  
This project identifies **critical flood-prone zones** in Kralingen-Crooswijk, Rotterdam, using a weighted overlay model. The analysis integrates:  
- **Land Elevation** (25% weight)  
- **Flow Accumulation** (30% weight)  
- **Slope** (15% weight)  
- **Proximity to Water Bodies** (20% weight)  
- **Land Use** (10% weight)  

**Formula**:  

Flood Risk Index = (0.30 * Flow Accumulation) + (0.15 * Slope)  
                + (0.25 * Elevation) + (0.20 * Water Body Proximity)  
                + (0.10 * Land Use)  
## Data & Methodology

### Data Sources

| Dataset              | Source              |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Elevation (AHN4)     | PDOK Netherlands    |
| Land Use            | Overpass Turbo    |
| Roads & Buildings    | OpenStreetMap (OSM) |
| watershed Boundary    |       KNMI         |

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:

* Reclassified raster layers into 3 risk classes (1=high, 2=medium, 3=low).
* All classes in output(Flood extent) classified as Flood prone

### Weighted Overlay:

* Combined layers in QGIS using the formula above.

### Validation:

* Cross-referenced with historical flood data from Dutch Water Authorities.

## Key Outputs

1.  **Flood Risk Zonation**
2.      * Flood extent

3.  **Asset Exposure**
       ### Exposed Assets
      
      * **Residential:**
          * Houses: 69
          * Apartments: 61
          * Houseboats: 22 
      * **Commercial:** 4
      * **Industrial:** 15
      * **Schools:** 2
      * **Service:** 6
      * **Sheds:** 2
      * **Water Tower:** 1

**Key Observations:**
* Residential buildings are the most affected category, with houses and apartments accounting for a significant portion of the total.
* The presence of houseboats among the affected buildings highlights the vulnerability of this specific type of residential structure in flood-prone areas.
* Commercial and industrial buildings are also affected, indicating potential economic impacts of flooding.
* Critical infrastructure like schools is also at risk, emphasizing the need for flood mitigation and preparedness measures.

# Land Use Summary
## Land Use Summary of the Study Area

| Land Use   | Area (sq. meters) | Percentage of Total Area |
|------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Residential | 5,026,782.75     | 81.2%                  | 
| Commercial  | 357,973.44      | 5.8%                  |
| Industrial  | 583,974.69      | 9.4%                  |
| Farmland   | 3,401.73        | 0.1%                  |
| Allotments  | 186,868.85      | 3.0%                  | 
| **Total**    | 6,159,001.47     | 100.0%                 |


## Land Use Summary of Flood Extent

| Land Use   | Area (sq. meters) | Percentage of Total Area |
|------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Residential | 725,063.35     | 80.6%                  | 
| Commercial  | 342,125.86      | 5.5%                  |
| Industrial  | 171,979.10      | 2.8%                  |
| Farmland   | 1,138.90        | 0.0%                  |
| **Total**    | 1,240,307.20     | 100.0%                 |


### Key Observations 

* **Residential areas are disproportionately affected by flooding.** While residential land use accounts for 81.2% of the total study area, it comprises 80.6% of the area directly impacted by the flood. This highlights the vulnerability of residential zones to flood events.
* **Commercial and Industrial areas are also impacted, but to a lesser extent than their overall coverage.** This suggests that these areas might be located in less flood-prone zones within the study area.
* **Farmland and allotments have a relatively minor proportion within both the total area and the flooded extent.** This indicates that these land uses are relatively less vulnerable to flooding in this particular context.
* **The overall land use distribution in the study area is dominated by residential areas, followed by industrial and commercial zones.** This context is important for understanding the potential impact of flooding on different sectors and communities.
